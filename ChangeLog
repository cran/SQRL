Version 1.0.2 (2023-12-03)

  * Results of metadata queries are now saved to the result parameter.
  * Temporary parameter values (inside <with> blocks) can now be read from file.
  * Fixed a bug where temporary passwords (set inside <with> blocks) would be
    ignored unless a permanent password had previously been set.
  * Temporary ping queries (set inside <with> blocks) are now retained beyond
    their normal scope/lifetime if deleting them would leave an open connection
    without a defined ping.
  * Improved dynamic-help fallback prints help to the R Console as plain text
    when tools or utils is unavailable, or when a rendering error occurs.
  * Minor alterations to vignette and manual.

Version 1.0.1 (2022-09-20)

  * Removed explicit namespacing of base:: functions.
  * Minor alterations to vignette and manual.
